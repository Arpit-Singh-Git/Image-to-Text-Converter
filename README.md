# Image Text and Visual Element Separation

This project analyzes an image to extract text and separate visual elements using Google Vision API and OpenCV. The extracted content is then organized into an HTML file.

## Features
- Analyzes images using Google Vision API
- Extracts text content with OCR
- Segments visual elements using OpenCV
- Creates an HTML file with extracted text and images of visual elements

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Google Cloud Vision API credentials
- OpenCV
- Pillow (PIL)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/image-text-visual-separation.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd image-text-visual-separation
   ```
3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Ensure you have your Google Cloud Vision API credentials set up. Follow the [Google Cloud Vision API setup guide](https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/setup) to get your credentials.
2. Place your image file (e.g., `img1.jpg`) in the project directory.
3. Run the script with the image file:
   ```bash
   python Image_Analysis_Tool.py img1.jpg
   ```

## Project Structure
- `Image_Analysis_Tool.py`: The main script that orchestrates the entire process.
- `requirements.txt`: Contains the list of required Python packages.
- `README.md`: Documentation of the project.
- `img1.jpg`: Example image file.

## Implementation Details

### Step 1: Analyze the Image
The `analyze_image` function uses the Google Vision API to analyze the uploaded image and extract text content.

### Step 2: Extract Text
The `extract_text` function processes the response from the Google Vision API to extract and return the text content.

### Step 3: Segment Visual Elements
The `segment_visual_elements` function uses OpenCV to segment visual elements from the image.

### Step 4: Create HTML Content
The `create_html` function creates an HTML file that includes the extracted text and embedded images of the visual elements.

### Step 5: Save HTML Content
The `save_html` function saves the generated HTML content to a file.

## Example
1. Place an image file (e.g., `img1.jpg`) in the project directory.
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python Image_Analysis_Tool.py img1.jpg
   ```
3. The output HTML file (`output.html`) will be generated in the project directory, containing the extracted text and visual elements from the image.

## Error Handling
The script includes basic error handling to manage issues such as:
- Problems with image analysis using the Google Vision API
- Failures in text extraction
- Errors during visual element segmentation
- Issues with creating or saving the HTML file
